- Able to fetch 3 month of contributions maximum.
- This contribution is based on github "PUSH" events.
  - If you made 3 commit at `7 July` and 4 commits at `8 July` and pushed all commits at `8 July`.
  - Git-Lawn recognizes that there's no commit on `7 July` and 7 commits on `8 July`.
- I will be working on these two issues, so please keep your eyes on ðŸ‘€.

<br>

## TL;DR

- Install by executing `npm install git-lawn` or `yarn add git-lawn`.
- Import by adding `import { GitLawn } from 'git-lawn'`.
- Use by adding `<GitLawn />`. Use `username` prop for fetch git contribution history
